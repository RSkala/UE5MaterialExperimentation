=============================================================
Material Graph Data Types

3 Basic Types (there are more than these):
* Constant / 1 float 
* Constant2Vector / 2 floats
* Constant3Vector / 3 floats

Note that constant2Vector has (R,G) and constant3Vector has (R,G,B) but these can be anything.
For example, if plugging into color socket RGB = Red, Green, and Blue Channels, but if plugging into a position socket, RGB will refer to XYZ, respectively.

----------------
BaseColor
* "BaseColor" is looking for a constant3Vector for Red, Green, and Blue Channels.

Keyboard Shortcut:
* If you hold 1,2,3, or 4 keys then left click in the Material Graph, you can quickly create one of the respective "Constant" types. For example, 3+left-click creates a Constant3Vector

Be sure to click the APPLY button in the upper left corner to affect the material.
"SAVE" also seems to apply the color.

Note:
* There seems to be a bug where changing the value of the color inside a Constant node doesn't change the color of the preview until you manually enter some value for any of the R,G,B parameters in the node.

=============================================================
Roughness

* This is a socket in the Material
* Requires a Constant1Vector (Constant, single float)
* Controls how "Reflective" a surface will be
  * A value of 1 = The surface will become completely "rough"
  * A value of 0 = The surface will become completely "reflective"
  * A value outside of 0 and 1 will have no effect (clamped to 0..1)

=============================================================
Lerp

HotKey: L + LeftClick

3 Sockets in the Lerp Node:
* A, B, Alpha
* Alpha is the percentage from value A to value B
* If Alpha is 0, then A is used
* If Alpha is 1, then B is used
* If Alpha is 0.5, then a value halfway is used (0.5)

Noise Texture
* Has random AREAS between 0 and 1 all over
* Unreal Engine has a built in Noise Texture in the Starter Pack
* T_Perlin_Noise_M

Texture Sample / External Textures
* Any time you want to use an external texture in the graph, you must "Sample" it first.
* Right-click -> Texture -> TextureSample
* A TextureSample uses and outputs the color values from a texture 
* With the TextureSample node selected, on the left, under Details, select:
  * Material Expression Texture Base -> Texture
* Here, we can select the T_Perlin_Noise_M texture

If you open the perlin noise texture, and turn on and off each RGB value, you can see that they are all the same.
So, it doesn't matter if we use R or G or B.
We just need a single value to connect to the Alpha in the Lerp node.
