Material Graph Data Types

3 Basic Types (there are more than these):
* Constant / 1 float 
* Constant2Vector / 2 floats
* Constant3Vector / 3 floats

Note that constant2Vector has (R,G) and constant3Vector has (R,G,B) but these can be anything.
For example, if plugging into color socket RGB = Red, Green, and Blue Channels, but if plugging into a position socket, RGB will refer to XYZ, respectively.

----------------
"BaseColor" is looking for a constant3Vector for Red, Green, and Blue Channels.

Keyboard Shortcut:
* If you hold 1,2,3, or 4 keys then left click in the Material Graph, you can quickly create one of the respective "Constant" types. For example, 3+left-click creates a Constant3Vector

Be sure to click the APPLY button in the upper left corner to affect the material.
"SAVE" also seems to apply the color.

Note:
* There seems to be a bug where changing the value of the color inside a Constant node doesn't change the color of the preview until you manually enter some value for any of the R,G,B parameters in the node.
